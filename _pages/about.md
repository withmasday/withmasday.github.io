<h3>About Me</h3>
I am a Informatics student at Gunadarma Univeristy - A teenager who likes time behind the computer screen, long time on the internet. Trying new things is my passion, at least I want to be someone who is an expert in various things. My passion lies in embracing the unfamiliar and venturing into uncharted territories. I am driven by a desire to continually broaden my horizons and become proficient in a myriad of disciplines. I aspire to evolve into a versatile individual, adept in various fields, and to cultivate expertise that transcends the boundaries of conventional knowledge.
